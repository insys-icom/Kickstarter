<h2>Status</h2>

<p>Kickstarter offers all information via an MQTT broker.
    The application within the Kickstarter container sends all information to an MQTT broker.
    This web site connects to that MQTT broker and visualizes the settings and the progress of getting new devices configured.
    So both &quot;MQTT broker&quot; and &quot;Kickstarter&quot; have to be &quot;online&quot; for everythin to work.
    </p>

<p>In case Kickstarter has been configured to upgrade the firmware, the target version is displayed here, too.</p>

<p>Kickstarter can keep track of the devices it processed in the last phase of processing a device, which is called &quot;aftercare&quot;.
   A new file can get started with the &quot;reset&quot; button.</p>

<p>The container runs a router advertiser daemon, that announces a local IPv6 network.
    In default settings this is <b>fdc2::/24</b>.</p>

<p>All IP devices connected to this LAN can now be contacted, even if they are in default settings and use the same IPv4 address 192.168.1.1/24.</p>

<p>The settings site should update itself in real time, a reload is normally not necessary.</p>
