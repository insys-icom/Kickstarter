<h3>Files</h3>

<h5>Stored files</h5>
<p>Kickstarter has a small file manager, where all existing files are listed in alphabetical order.
    All files get stored on a neutral space, so updating the container doesn't delete the stored files.</p>

<p>The file size in Bytes, the last modified date and the start and ending bytes of the SHA256 checksum should help to identify uploaded files.
    The full checksum string is displayed when hovering the mouse above it.</p>

<p>Every file can get deleted and downloaded.
    This autmatically disables the action, where the file is still in use.</p>

<p>Uploading new files happens immediatelly in the background, when a file has been selected.
    It's possible to upload several files at once, when several files get selected.</p>
